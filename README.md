+ Best-fit is an online algorithm for bin packing. Its input is a list of items of different sizes. 
Its output is a packing - a partition of the items into bins of fixed capacity, 
such that the sum of sizes of items in each bin is at most the capacity. Ideally, 
we would like to use as few bins as possible, but minimizing the number of bins is an NP-hard problem. 
The best-fit algorithm uses the following heuristic:

It keeps a list of open bins, which is initially empty.
When an item arrives, it find a bin with the maximum load into which the item can fit, if any.
If such a bin is found, the new item is placed inside it.
Otherwise, a new bin is opened and the coming item is placed inside it.
```

This is a Best-fit 2Dbinpackingalgorithm.

We are given several types of products, several types of box with their prices and the total number of units of each product that must be put in the box.

This algorithm will select the best suitable boxes for the given product list. It will select the best boxes according to the dimensions of the products ( Height and length ), and the prices of the boxes.
Then it will add each unit of each product in the appropriate box

for example, we got:

product_Types_list = [Product("P0",40,340,2), Product("P1",100,10,10)]

quantityProducts = [100,10]

box_Types_list = [Box("B0",100,700,100), Box("B1",100,700,100)]


the program will add every products in corresponding boxes
